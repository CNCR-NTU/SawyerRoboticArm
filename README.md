# CNCR Lab @ NTU - Sawyer Robotic Arm

This repository was created for Sawyer Robotic Arm.

## Details

This repository is a ROS package, providing code for the Sawyer robotic arm :
* sawyer_robot_simulation will help you getting started with the Gazebo simulator
* sawyer_robot_code will help you working on the actual robot
These folders contain scripts ready to be used on their own, or useful functions to help you use Sawyer more easily.

This repository is still being worked on. Don't hesitate to contact the maintainer of each package in case of any problem.
If you want to work on the code itself, documentation is provided in the doc file. Open files.html to open the documentation in your browser.
